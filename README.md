Panopto plugin for Blackboard 9.1 @ Newcastle University
========================================================

What is it?
-----------

This is a block for Blackboard 9.1, that allows courses in Blackboard to link directly to Panopto folders. It also allows for SSO between Blackboard and Panopto, and automatically syncs user permissions between both systems. This version also allows huge numbers of courses and organisations to be provisioned in one go.

This was initially built by Panopto and further adjusted by Andrew Martin and Nacer Anou at Newcastle University mainly in order to make provisioning of a large number of courses work, and then the same functionality again was adapted to work for communities (A.K.A. Blackboard "organisations")
